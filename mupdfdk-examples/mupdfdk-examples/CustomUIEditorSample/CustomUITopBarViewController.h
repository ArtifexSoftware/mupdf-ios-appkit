// This is part of the Custom-UI sample. It contains the base class
// used by the view controllers that form the hierarchical menu
// within the top bar of the app and the protocol via which those
// classes comminicate to the main view controller. This structuring
// isn't a nessary part of using this SDK. It is just a specific
// mechanism we have chosen. It may be useful to copy to some degree
// since most apps will distribute the UI across several classes and
// need a way for them to communicate.

// The CustomUIMainViewControllerAPI prototcol contains the methods
// and properties via which the menu view controllers access details
// of the main view, in particular the document view itself

// The CustomUITopBarViewController class is the base class for
// each of the view controllers used in the top bar menu. The main
// view passes itself to the root of these view controllers by setting
// the mainViewController property, the root passes it on to its
// children and they pass it on to theirs.
//
// The main view controller will also call updateUI on any state
// change that may require changes in the UI, and will call
// barWillClose just before the document is closed. Again these
// calls pass down the menu hierarchy.
//
// docViewController, session and doc, are just convenience properties
// for accessing objects within the stucture of mainViewController.
