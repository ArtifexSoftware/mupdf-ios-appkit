// Protocols used in page-positioning classes. ARDKPageCellDelegate
// is implemented by each page view, and ARDKPageCell is implemented
// by the containing views that control the page view's position
// and movement. The protocols permit communication between the
// two. ARDKCollectionViewCell is an implementation of ARDKPageCell
// for use with UICollectionViews.
//
// Cells control their delagate's motion by having them as subviews
// and moving themselves. That is why none of the methods below
// relate to movement.

// When pages move off screen, rather than destroy them, they are
// cached and later reused. In between uses prepareForReuse is
// called.
- (void)prepareForReuse;

// For each use (the first and for any reuse), useForPageNumber:withSize:
// is called.
- (void)useForPageNumber:(NSInteger)pageNumber withSize:(CGSize)size;

// setSelected is called to control highlighting of the selected page
- (void)setSelected:(BOOL)selected;

// Called to ensure a page completely redraws on next render
- (void)onContentChange;
